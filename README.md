We have all become familiar with the concept of Ride Share services such as Uber and Lyft. Without needing a car or a taxi we can pay for a stranger to pick us up and take us virtually anywhere within reason. With that being said, can this extend to other means of transportation? What about bicycles? Seemingly an increasing form of transportation yet again with younger generations (and the growing difficulty of getting a car), it would make sense to extend a ride service to bikes. However, will such a service actually succeed? This is what has been set out to be proven. More specifically: Can a bike-share service run through Citi Bank become profitable in Des Moines? Let's find out!

# Results and Processes

Data was extracted and transformed from bike share data taken in August 2019 from the Citi Bike website. This data was slightly modified and then imported into the data visualization software known as "Tableau." In this software data was comprised into dimensions and measures, both of which were compiled and edited to create the visualizations you will see below and in the Tableau Story linked at the top.


### Customers vs Subscribers

The bikeshare data provided contained just over 2,300,000 individuals' data in relation to their demographics and usage of citibike. Of these participants, the overwhelming majority were subscribers to the citbike service as opposed to customers. This shows retention of clients and gives credence to the concept of bikesharing by itself being potentially profitable.


### Peak Ride Times in August, 2019

The Citibike got plenty of uses ini August of 2019. Specifiically, the times where the bikes were used the most were hours 7 to 10 and hours 16 to 19. These hours correspond most closely with the times people head into work or class and the times people leave work or class. This makes sense as people need transportation to and from these occupations.
